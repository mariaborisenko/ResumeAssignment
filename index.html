Having handled diverse roles, including resin artist and photographer, I possess a keen eye for aesthetics, an understanding of composition, and an ability to create compelling visual narratives - critical skills in web design. My expertise in various Adobe Creative Suite tools, UI, and content creation, further positions me to excel in the web design industry.</p>
